    <p id = "para"> In my own free time, I find peace in painting and looking back to how I spend my leisure, and it has undoubtedly been worth it. My paintings have been quite inspiring to my friends and me as they are mostly of issues in life. Once I sat down and set my mind on a painting, I tend to get into the brush itself and paint just as how I view the inspiration.

As people look for hobbies to engage in, there are certain benefits they look forward to reaping in it. Painting as a hobby has been a great way to relax. In life, I encounter challenges and various stumbling blocks. </p>
